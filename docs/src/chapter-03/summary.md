# Chapter 03 – Knowledge‑Base (VectorDB) Documentation Overview

This chapter explains how GeneralBots manages knowledge‑base collections, indexing, caching, and semantic search. The implementation now references a generic **VectorDB** (instead of a specific Qdrant instance) and highlights the use of the **.gbdrive** package for storage when needed.

| Document | File | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **README** | [README.md](README.md) | High‑level reference for the `.gbkb` package and its core commands (`ADD_KB`, `SET_KB`, `ADD_WEBSITE`). |
| **Caching** | [caching.md](caching.md) | Optional in‑memory and persistent SQLite caching to speed up frequent `FIND` queries. |
| **Context Compaction** | [context-compaction.md](context-compaction.md) | Techniques to keep the LLM context window within limits (summarization, memory pruning, sliding window). |
| **Indexing** | [indexing.md](indexing.md) | Process of extracting, chunking, embedding, and storing document vectors in the VectorDB. |
| **VectorDB Integration** | [qdrant.md](qdrant.md) | (Renamed) Details the VectorDB connection, collection mapping, and operations. References to **Qdrant** have been generalized to **VectorDB**. |
| **Semantic Search** | [semantic-search.md](semantic-search.md) | How the `FIND` keyword performs meaning‑based retrieval using the VectorDB. |
| **Vector Collections** | [vector-collections.md](vector-collections.md) | Definition and management of vector collections, including creation, document addition, and usage in dialogs. |
