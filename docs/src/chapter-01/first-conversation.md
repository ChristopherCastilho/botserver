# First Conversation

After the server is running, open a web browser at `http://localhost:8080` and start a chat. The default dialog (`start.bas`) greets the user and demonstrates the `TALK` keyword.

```basic
TALK "Welcome to GeneralBots! How can I assist you today?"
```

You can type a question, and the bot will respond using the LLM backend combined with any relevant knowledgeâ€‘base entries.
