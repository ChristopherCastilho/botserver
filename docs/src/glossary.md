**Answer Mode** - Configuration that determines how the bot responds to user queries (direct LLM, with tools, documents only, etc.)

**AST** - Abstract Syntax Tree, the compiled representation of BASIC scripts used for execution

## B
**BASIC** - The scripting language used in .gbdialog files for creating conversational flows

**BotSession** - A single conversation instance between a user and bot, maintaining context and history

## C
**Collection** - A group of documents in a knowledge base that are indexed together for semantic search

**Context** - The current state and history of a conversation that influences bot responses

## D
**Dialog** - A conversation script written in BASIC that defines bot behavior and flow

## E
**Embedding** - A vector representation of text used for semantic similarity comparisons

## G
**.gbai** - General Bot Application Interface, the root package containing bot architecture

**.gbdialog** - Package containing BASIC scripts for conversation flows

**.gbkb** - General Bot Knowledge Base, package for document collections and semantic search

**.gbot** - Package containing bot configuration and parameters

**.gbtheme** - Package for UI theming and customization

## K
**Knowledge Base** - A collection of documents that provide contextual information to the bot

## L

## Q
**Qdrant** - Vector database used for semantic search and embeddings

## S
**Session** - See BotSession

**Semantic Search** - Search method that finds content based on meaning rather than just keywords
