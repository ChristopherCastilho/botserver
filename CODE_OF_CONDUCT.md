# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or presentation, sexual orientation, physical appearance, religious affiliation, creed, marital or familial status, will not tolerate abuse or discriminatory or sexual harassment toward any person during any conference-related activities, including but not limited to submission, reviewing, tutorials, workshops, or social events. Abuse includes any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that personâ€™s participation or (b) causes that person to fear for their personal safety. This includes threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, or other types of abuse. Discriminatory harassment includes any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on the basis of age, race, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or presentation, sexual orientation, physical appearance, religious affiliation, creed, marital or familial status, disability, personal characteristics, or any other differentiating factors, as well as any other characteristic protected by law in the location where conference activity takes place. Sexual harassment includes (but is not limited to) repeated unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, disability, personal characteristics, or any other differentiating factors, as well as any other characteristic protected by law in the location where activity takes place.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
