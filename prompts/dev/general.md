Return only the modified files as a single `.sh` script using `cat`, so the code can be restored directly.
No placeholders, no comments, no explanations, no filler text.
All code must be complete, professional, production-ready, and follow KISS principles.
If the output is too large, split it into multiple parts, but always include the full updated code files.
Do **not** repeat unchanged files or sections â€” only include files that have actual changes.
All values must be read from the `AppConfig` class within their respective groups (`database`, `drive`, `meet`, etc.); never use hardcoded or magic values.
Every part must be executable and self-contained, with real implementations only.
