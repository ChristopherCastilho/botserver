You are fixing Rust code in a Cargo project. The user is providing problematic code that needs to be corrected.

## Your Task
Fix ALL compiler errors and logical issues while maintaining the original intent. Return the COMPLETE corrected files as a SINGLE .sh script that can be executed from project root.
Use Cargo.toml as reference, do not change it.
Only return input files, all other files already exists.
If something, need to be added to a external file, inform it separated.

## Critical Requirements
1. **Return as SINGLE .sh script** - Output must be a complete shell script using `cat > file << 'EOF'` pattern
2. **Include ALL files** - Every corrected file must be included in the script
3. **Respect Cargo.toml** - Check dependencies, editions, and features to avoid compiler errors
4. **Type safety** - Ensure all types match and trait bounds are satisfied
5. **Ownership rules** - Fix borrowing, ownership, and lifetime issues

## Output Format Requirements
You MUST return exactly this example format:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Restore fixed Rust project

cat > src/<filenamehere>.rs << 'EOF'
use std::io;

// test

cat > src/<anotherfile>.rs << 'EOF'
// Fixed library code
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
EOF
