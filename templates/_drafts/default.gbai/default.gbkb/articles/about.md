# Custom Development

General Bots uses natural language to understand what people want, making code development easier. When someone says, "I need the monthly report" or "Print the report for the month," General Bots understands the same thing. Use our development tools to extend the conversation with your own rules and intents.

# Discovery

General Bots can proactively suggest its abilities to users based on context, such as requesting an order, sending a message, scheduling a conference call, or any action defined in your application.

# Make it Personal

Deliver unique experiences through the knowledge that General Bots has about your users and their preferences, helping to make decisions and always presenting the best scenario.

# No Additional Downloads

Your application's interface is automatically integrated with General Bots, so thereâ€™s no need for additional downloads or installations.
